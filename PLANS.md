# Esper Go migration active ExecPlan

This is the resumable plan for Codex migration work. Keep it accurate while a
work unit is in progress. It is an operational checkpoint, not a second
roadmap or an append-only history.

## Plan maintenance

- At task start, verify this checkpoint against Git, the manifest, evidence,
  and the roadmap. Memory or an older conversation is not current evidence.
- Before editing production code, fill in the work-unit contract and mark the
  first incomplete progress item.
- After investigation, implementation, validation, review, or a material
  decision, update the relevant section with concrete paths and commands.
- Keep only the current work unit and at most five one-line recent outcomes.
  Detailed completed history belongs in CHANGELOG and Git.
- Maintain the delegation checkpoint for the active unit. Parallel shell
  commands are not subagent delegation. Before implementation, record the
  Java/Go scout agent IDs or the exact serial-fallback reason; after targeted
  validation, record the independent reviewer ID and result.
- On interruption, leave the worktree state, exact failing command, and the
  next safe step.
- Record validation and outcome before the semantic commit. Never edit this
  file to claim results that have not run.

## Outcome

Continue the fixed-commit Esper 9.0.0 to Go migration until the final
acceptance criteria in `docs/esper-go-port-quality-strategy.md` all pass.
Progress is measured by verified work units and manifest evidence, not agent
activity or a single coverage percentage.

## Current work unit
Active: Draft 4.550 ('expr-dt-set-nested').

- Contract frozen (JavaContract550 + GoSurface550): ExprDTSet (ords
  0-1) + ExprDTNested (ord 0, 2 milestones), 3 executions, 2 files.
  SetInput/SetFields/Nested all REPRESENTABLE; 'week' already unblocked
  by the 4.549 hybrid core (set('week',8) → 2002-02-21); Java's 0-based
  Calendar month args map to Go's 1-based convention per rep;
  year-7 pre-cutover Julian handled by the hybrid model; milestone 2
  adds .toCalendar() via DateTimeToTime.
- [x] Assets550 dispatched (runner expr_dt_set_nested_550.go, scenario
  expr-dt-set-nested-550.json, oracle ExprDTSetNested550ScenarioOracle,
  mode expr-dt-set-nested-550).
- [x] Assets550 delivered + integrated: Java trace 8 records, Go
  replay 8, `-diff` passing / 0 differences; evidence + traces
  checked in. year-7 pre-cutover Julian -61933561200000 byte-exact on
  BOTH sides (hybrid model vindicated); Go month args remapped 1-based.
- [x] Manifest: NEW case.expr-dt-set-nested born-DV with the 3 IDs
  (expr.core mapping added); summary → 781 cases / 404 DV / 1612 DV
  runtime IDs / 426 unreferenced.
- [x] Gates: `make check` GREEN (after mapping fix).
- [x] ParityRev550 + JavaContract551 + GoSurface551 dispatched.
- [ ] Review outcome, commit, push.


## Previous work units (shipped)

- Shipped: Draft 4.549 ('expr-dt-with-minmax') committed and pushed as
  f1c6e7599; Git owns identity. 4 executions born-DV (8 records each,
  0 differences); review PASS + confirmation PASS — real shared-core
  fix: hybrid GregorianCalendar (inverse-JDN decompose + forward JDN
  recompose + Julian week grid) across all calop applies;
  set('week') accepted.




- Shipped: Draft 4.548 ('event-avro-hook') committed and pushed as
  9c98f57cd; Git owns identity. EventAvroHook 4/4 born-DV (14 records
  each, 0 differences); review PASS, two P3s fixed (build-error kind
  check, schema record-name assertion); event.avro-record gained
  differential-verified.

- Shipped: Draft 4.547 ('event-map-nested') committed and pushed as
  88ee76ee4; Git owns identity. EventMapNested 4/4 born-DV (6 records
  each, 0 differences); review PASS, two P3s fixed (dead statements
  map, overstated deploy doc).

- Shipped: Draft 4.546 ('event-render') committed and pushed as
  a13138036; Git owns identity. All 7 EventRender* executions born-DV
  (37 records each, 0 differences); review PASS, two P3s fixed (null-key
  send comment, misleading mutation-subtest names).




- Shipped: Draft 4.545 ('event-infra-contained-render-sender-supertype')
  committed and pushed as 8c07533b2; Git owns identity. All 8 executions
  born-DV (235 records each, 0 differences); review PASS, three P3s fixed
  (header wording, dead var, manifest scope note).

- Shipped: Draft 4.544 ('event-infra-property-non-dynamic') committed
  and pushed as 756f32910; Git owns identity. Parity review PASS, one

  differences; manifest 775 cases / 398 DV / 1582 DV IDs / 456
  unreferenced.
- Shipped: Draft 4.543 ('event-infra-property-dynamic') committed and

  (P1 orphaned sixth execution NonSimple -> covered as 6th case; P3
  stale AllowDynamicFields claim removed) -> confirmation PASS with 2
  residual P3s fixed. Java/Go 879 records each, 0 differences.
- Shipped: Draft 4.542 ('event-infra-getter-nested-fragment') committed
  and pushed as 4d497d022; Git owns identity. PASS after one P3 fix.

## Deferred work items

- `ResultSetQueryTypeGroupByWithComputation` + `MixedAccessAggregation`:
  groupby-computation requires engine fix for non-aggregated non-grouped
  column null-out at coarser rollup levels; mixed-access requires window(*)
  event-reference trace normalization. Both investigated via
  `GrpCompMixedJavaContract`/`GrpCompMixedGoSurface` scouts; contracts
  frozen in session transcripts.
- `BoundRollup2Dim` join variant: join+rollup+window-expiry produces extra
  IR-pair rows in Go's new array vs Java's newData-only listener; needs
  deeper engine investigation of grouped-rollup IR-pair row emission.
- `SelectWildcardNoName`: auto-name `subselect_1` has no Go chain-API form
  (approved difference, already documented).
